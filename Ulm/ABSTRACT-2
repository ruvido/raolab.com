Protein dynamics II: going beyond reaction coordinates


Molecular dynamics simulations allow an atomistic understanding of protein
conformational changes.  The classical picture postulates the existence of a
suitable reaction coordinate to monitor the transition, disentangling the
starting and ending state as well as the barrier between them. Notwithstanding,
it is difficult to find such a coordinate because of the many degrees of
freedom involved and the presence of thermal fluctuations. Recently, a new
arsenal of tools that make use of complex networks has emerged to characterize
these problems. Transition networks allow a high resolution mapping of
the underlying free-energy landscape without invoking arbitrarily chosen
reaction coordinates, paving the way for an unbiased, quantitative description
of protein conformational changes.
