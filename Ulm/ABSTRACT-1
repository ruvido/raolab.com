Protein dynamics I: a general introduction


Cellular life is based on protein activity. The traditional structure-function
paradigm, “to know function study structure” which goes back to Watson and
Crick, have guided our interpretation of protein function for decades. It is
only rather recently that the role of dynamics has been recognized, supporting
the idea that structural analysis is not sufficient to fully understand protein
function. It is very difficult to study protein dynamics experimentally at an
atomic level of detail, although techniques such as single-molecule FRET, X-ray
crystallography, and NMR supply useful, but limited, information. Consequently,
molecular dynamics simulations are playing an increasing role in determining
the mechanism, as a supplement to the experimental studies. A general
discussion of the field is presented, with special emphasis on molecular
dynamics simulations.
